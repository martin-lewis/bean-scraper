# bean-scraper
This is a small program designed to allow for simple command line scraping of podcasts from RSS links
Designed for primary use on linux (specifically debian) but should work on any system with a python interpreter

Its not very quick or clever and is designed in more of a batch process style, perhaps run once a day to get any new files
